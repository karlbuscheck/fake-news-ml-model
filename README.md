# Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict Fake News

Can a computer tell the difference between real and fake news?

In this project, I use natural language processing and machine learning to build a model that tries to do just that. 
In this era of information overload and misinformation, it's a small step in the fight -- and a fun way to explore 
how computers understand text.

## The Roadmap
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Transform text with TF-IDF vectorization
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate using a confusion matrix and classification report
- Summarize the key takeaway

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** — for writing and running Python code interactively
- **Python 3.12.2**
- **pandas** — for data manipulation and analysis
- **re** - for text cleaning and regular expressions
- **TfidfVectorizer** - for feature extraction from text
- **scikit-learn** — for machine learning model training and evaluation

## Acknowledgements

I came up with the idea for this model while working on a project in my NLP course, taught by Michele Samorani, 
Associate Professor in the Department of Information Systems and Analytics at the Leavey School of Business at 
Santa Clara University. The dataset used in this project also comes from that class.

## Note
This notebook is a work in progress. The only way to code is to practice. Stay tuned for more
